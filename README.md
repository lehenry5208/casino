# Lucky Trio Casino – Proof of Concept

## Overview
Lucky Trio Casino is a browser-based application that simulates three popular casino games: **Slots, Blackjack, and Roulette**. This project demonstrates the integration of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create interactive, probability-based games. The proof-of-concept currently implements the **Slot Machine**, showing that game logic, UI, and user interaction can be successfully combined in a web environment.

The project is intended for users who want a **safe, virtual, and entertaining experience** without real-money gambling. It also provides educational value by demonstrating programming concepts such as state management, probability, and UI design.
